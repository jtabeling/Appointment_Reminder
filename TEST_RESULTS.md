# Test Results - Current Status

## ✅ What's Working

Your appointment reminder system **IS WORKING**:
- ✅ Calls being placed successfully
- ✅ Reaching your phone (443-506-3813)
- ✅ Twilio credentials working
- ✅ Excel processing working
- ✅ Application runs correctly

## ⚠️ Known Issue

**Appointment message is not being spoken** - only generic Twilio demo message plays.

### Why?

Twilio requires a **public TwiML endpoint** to get instructions on what to say. We're currently using:
- `http://demo.twilio.com/docs/voice.xml` (static demo message)

Your custom appointment message is being generated but cannot be passed to the call because we need a dynamic TwiML endpoint.

## The Solution

You need to create a **Twilio Function** that can accept the message and return TwiML.

### Step-by-Step Fix

1. Go to: https://www.twilio.com/console/functions
2. Click "Create Function"
3. Choose "Blank" template
4. Name: "Appointment Reminder"
5. Paste this code:

```javascript
exports.handler = function(context, event, callback) {
    const twiml = new Twilio.twiml.VoiceResponse();
    const message = event.message || 'This is your appointment reminder.';
    twiml.say({voice: 'alice', language: 'en-US'}, message);
    twiml.pause({length: 2});
    twiml.say({voice: 'alice', language: 'en-US'}, 'Thank you, goodbye.');
    callback(null, twiml);
};
```

6. Click "Deploy"
7. Copy the function URL (like: `https://xxxx-xxxx.twilio.run`)
8. Tell me the URL and I'll update `src/caller.py` line 231

## After Setup

Once you give me the URL, I'll update the code and your calls will speak:
> "Hello Test Call 1, this is an automated reminder that you have an appointment scheduled for October 30, 2025 at 09:58 AM..."

## Alternative: Quick Test Now

If you want to test right away without setting up Twilio Functions, you can use **ngrok**:

1. Download ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Run: `python src/twiml_server.py` (in one terminal)
3. Run: `ngrok http 8000` (in another terminal)
4. Copy the ngrok URL
5. Tell me the URL

## Summary

- **Current Status**: Calls working, message not
- **Fix**: Create Twilio Function or use ngrok
- **Time**: 2-5 minutes
- **Result**: Full appointment message will play
