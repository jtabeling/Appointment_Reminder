# Status Callbacks Implementation - Complete ✅

## What's Been Done

Your Appointment Reminder System now fully supports **Twilio Status Callbacks** for real-time call status tracking!

## Two Ways to Track Status

### Method 1: Polling (Default - Works Now)
- No setup required
- Waits 10 seconds, then queries Twilio
- Already working in your system
- Good for most cases

### Method 2: Status Callbacks (Added - Optional)
- Real-time updates from Twilio
- More accurate durations
- Industry best practice
- Requires ngrok or server

## How Status Callbacks Work

1. **You create a call** with a status callback URL
2. **Twilio sends updates** to your URL as events happen:
   - `initiated` - Call started
   - `ringing` - Call ringing
   - `answered` - Call answered
   - `completed` - Call finished
3. **Your server receives** these updates in real-time
4. **Batch logger uses** the real-time status

## Files Added

- ✅ `src/status_callback_handler.py` - Webhook server
- ✅ `start_with_callbacks.py` - Quick test script
- ✅ Updated `src/caller.py` - Callback support
- ✅ Updated `src/app.py` - Callback integration
- ✅ `IMPLEMENT_STATUS_CALLBACKS.md` - Setup guide

## Current Status

**Polling**: ✅ Active and working  
**Callbacks**: ✅ Code complete, needs ngrok/server

## To Use Callbacks

1. Follow steps in `IMPLEMENT_STATUS_CALLBACKS.md`
2. Or run `python start_with_callbacks.py data/batch_test.xlsx`

## Benefits Over Polling

✅ **No wait time** - updates arrive immediately  
✅ **More accurate** - real duration data  
✅ **Complete history** - see full call progression  
✅ **Standard approach** - how Twilio recommends it

**Both methods are ready to use!** Polling works now. Callbacks need ngrok setup.
