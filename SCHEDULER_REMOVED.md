# Scheduler Removed - App Now Places Calls Immediately

## What Changed

All scheduling functionality has been removed. The app now has a single, simple behavior:

**Launch → Load appointments → Place calls → Exit**

## Key Changes

### Removed Components
- ❌ APScheduler (periodic check scheduling)
- ❌ Scheduler class integration
- ❌ Scheduled call management
- ❌ Future-dated call handling
- ❌ "Waiting for scheduled times" logic
- ❌ All scheduling configuration

### Simplified Workflow

**Before** (with scheduler):
1. Load appointments
2. Calculate when to call (e.g., 24 hours before)
3. Schedule calls for future
4. Wait and periodically check
5. Call when time arrives

**Now** (immediate):
1. Load appointments
2. Place all calls immediately
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Fetch final status
5. Log results
6. Exit

## Usage

Just run with an Excel file:
```bash
python src/app.py data/your_appointments.xlsx
```

**What happens**:
1. Loads all appointments from Excel
2. Places all calls immediately
3. Waits 10 seconds for calls to progress
4. Fetches final status for all calls
5. Logs results to CSV
6. Prints statistics
7. Exits

## What's Still Working

✅ Batch logging to CSV  
✅ Status tracking  
✅ Error handling  
✅ Statistics reporting  
✅ All logging  

## Configuration Simplified

Removed from `config/settings.yaml`:
- `scheduling.reminder_hours_before`
- `scheduling.timezone`
- `scheduling.check_interval_minutes`
- `scheduling.call_immediately`

Still configured:
- `calling.max_retries`
- `calling.retry_delay_seconds`
- `calling.status_callback_url` (optional)
- `data.required_columns`
- `message.message_template`
- `logging.*`

## Benefits

✅ Simpler code  
✅ Faster execution  
✅ Easier to understand  
✅ No background processes  
✅ One-shot execution

**The app is now a simple batch caller: load and call!**
