# Active Context

## Current Focus
Project 100% complete! Fully functional, tested, and deployed to GitHub.

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Built complete Python application with all modules
- ✅ Implemented Excel file processing with validation
- ✅ Created Twilio/Google Voice integration with retry logic
- ✅ Configured TwiML Function endpoint successfully
- ✅ Implemented immediate call mode
- ✅ Tested with real calls - working perfectly
- ✅ Built scheduler with APScheduler for periodic checks
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging and error handling
- ✅ Created configuration management system
- ✅ Wrote complete documentation (20+ files)
- ✅ Added sample data generator
- ✅ Created and pushed to GitHub repository
- ✅ Secured all credentials and sensitive data

## Current State
Project is **PRODUCTION READY**:
- All core modules implemented, tested, and working
- TwiML Function endpoint configured
- Real calls tested successfully
- Configuration system in place
- Complete documentation available
- GitHub repository active at jtabeling/Appointment_Reminder
- All credentials protected
- Immediate call mode functional
- Ready for immediate production use

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. **Deploy as Windows service** for automated operation
2. **Add monitoring dashboard** for call tracking
3. **Implement batch processing** for large volumes
4. **Add email/SMS fallback** options

## Active Decisions
- **Google Voice Integration**: Using Twilio as primary option (successfully working)
- **TwiML Endpoint**: Using Twilio Functions (configured and tested)
- **Scheduling**: Using APScheduler for robust task scheduling
- **Call Timing**: Default to 24 hours before appointment, with immediate mode option
- **File Format**: Support both .xls and .xlsx formats
- **Call Mode**: Immediate mode implemented for testing and quick reminders

## Considerations
- Need to handle time zones properly
- Phone number format validation important
- Consider rate limiting for Google Voice API
- Need fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Compliance considerations for automated calling

## Project Milestones Achieved
1. ✅ Application fully built and functional
2. ✅ Twilio integration complete with working calls
3. ✅ TwiML endpoint configured with custom messages
4. ✅ Real-world testing successful (calls reaching phones)
5. ✅ Immediate call mode implemented
6. ✅ Complete documentation created
7. ✅ GitHub repository published
8. ✅ All credentials secured
