- All credentials protected
- Ready for immediate production use

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. **Review branch**: updated-message ready for PR
2. **Merge to main**: After review approval
3. **Update README**: Reflect location field support

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. **Deploy as Windows service** for automated operation
2. **Add monitoring dashboard** for call tracking
3. **Implement email/SMS fallback** options
4. **Add status callback server** deployment guide

## Active Decisions
- **Google Voice Integration**: Using Twilio as primary option (successfully working)

## Considerations
- Need to handle time zones properly
- Phone number format validation important
- Consider rate limiting for Google Voice API
- Need fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Compliance considerations for automated calling
