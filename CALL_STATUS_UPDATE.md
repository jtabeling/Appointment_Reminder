# Call Status and Batch Logging - Complete Implementation

## What's Been Implemented

Your Appointment Reminder System now has **comprehensive call tracking** with two methods:

### Method 1: Polling (Current - Working)
- Places calls
- Waits 10 seconds
- Queries Twilio API for final status
- Logs to CSV

### Method 2: Status Callbacks (Added - Optional)
- Places calls with callback URL
- Receives real-time updates from Twilio
- More accurate, no delays
- Code ready, needs ngrok/server setup

## Current Features Working

### ✅ Batch Call Logging (CSV)
**File**: `logs/batch_call_results.csv`

**Columns**:
- batch_id - Unique batch identifier
- timestamp - When batch was processed  
- name - Person called
- phone_number - Number called
- appointment_date - Appointment date/time
- call_answered - Yes/No
- call_status - Twilio status
- call_duration_seconds - Duration in seconds
- call_duration_formatted - Human-readable duration
- call_id - Twilio call ID
- error_message - Errors if any

### ✅ Status Tracking Methods

**Method 1: API Polling** (Active)
- Uses `client.calls(call_id).fetch()` to check status
- Works immediately, verified working
- Current wait time: 10 seconds

**Method 2: Status Callbacks** (Ready)
- Code implemented in `status_callback_handler.py`
- Requires public URL (ngrok or server)
- Provides real-time updates
- See `STATUS_CALLBACK_GUIDE.md`

## Twilio API Capabilities Confirmed

✅ **Status Callbacks** - Twilio can POST to your URL with:
- initiated, ringing, answered, completed statuses
- Call duration
- Error codes
- Complete call metadata

✅ **API Fetching** - Can query call status:
- Current implementation using `fetch()`
- Returns status and duration
- Already working in your system

## How to Use

### Current (Polling Method)
Just run the app - polling happens automatically:
```bash
python src/app.py data/your_appointments.xlsx
```

### Future (Callback Method)
1. Set up ngrok: `ngrok http 8080`
2. Update `config/settings.yaml` with callback URL
3. Run the callback server
4. Run the app

## Test Results

Batch logging verified working:
- ✅ CSV file created
- ✅ All columns populated
- ✅ Call IDs tracked
- ✅ Status recorded
- ✅ Duration captured (when available)
