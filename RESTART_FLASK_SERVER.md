# Important: Restart Flask Server!

## Critical Fix Applied

I've fixed a **process isolation issue** where the Flask server and app were using separate memory spaces. 

**Solution**: Changed from in-memory storage to file-based JSON storage (`logs/webhook_responses.json`).

## Action Required

**You MUST restart your Flask webhook server** for the fix to take effect:

1. **Stop the current Flask server** (Ctrl+C in Flask terminal)

2. **Restart Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python src/webhook_server.py
   ```

3. **Keep ngrok running** (don't restart it, just keep the tunnel active)

4. **Then test again**:
   ```bash
   python src/app.py data/ready_to_test.xlsx
   ```

## What Changed

- **Before**: Responses stored in Flask server's memory (not accessible to app)
- **After**: Responses saved to `logs/webhook_responses.json` (shared file)

The app will now read responses from the same file that Flask writes to!

## Expected Behavior After Restart

1. User presses 1 or 2 → Flask saves to JSON file
2. App waits 30 seconds → Reads from JSON file
3. CSV shows `confirmed` or `cancelled` ✅
