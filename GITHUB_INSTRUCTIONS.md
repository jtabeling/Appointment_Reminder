# GitHub Repository - Final Step

## Your Code is Ready!

All code is committed locally. Now you need to create the repository on GitHub and push.

## Option 1: Browser Authentication (Recommended)

The GitHub CLI is waiting for you to authenticate in your browser:

**Follow these steps:**

1. Open this URL: https://github.com/login/device
2. Enter code: **CDE7-48E0**
3. Click "Continue"
4. Authorize GitHub CLI

After you complete authentication in the browser, come back here and tell me "authenticated" and I'll push your code!

## Option 2: Web Interface (Alternative)

If browser authentication doesn't work:

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: **Appointment_Reminder**
3. Description: "Automated appointment reminder system using Twilio"
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** check any boxes (README, .gitignore, license)
6. Click "Create repository"

Then run these commands:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/jtabeling/Appointment_Reminder.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Current Status

- ✅ Git initialized
- ✅ All files committed (2 commits)
- ✅ Remote configured
- ⏳ Waiting for authentication

## After Pushing

Your repository will be at:
**https://github.com/jtabeling/Appointment_Reminder**

---

**Next Step**: Complete browser authentication at https://github.com/login/device with code CDE7-48E0
