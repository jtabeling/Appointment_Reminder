# Message Setup - Current Status

## ✅ What's Working

Your appointment reminder system is working:
- ✅ Twilio credentials configured
- ✅ Excel file processing
- ✅ Calls being placed successfully
- ✅ Reaching your phone number

## ⚠️ What's Missing

The appointment message is not being spoken. Instead, a generic Twilio demo message plays.

### Why?

Twilio needs a **public URL** to fetch TwiML (Telephony Markup Language) that tells it what to say. We're currently using Twilio's demo URL which has a fixed generic message.

## Quick Fix (3 Options)

### 1️⃣ Twilio Functions (Easiest - 2 min)

1. Go to: https://www.twilio.com/console/functions
2. Click "Create Function"
3. Choose "Blank"
4. Name: "Appointment Reminder"
5. Paste this code:

```javascript
exports.handler = function(context, event, callback) {
    const twiml = new Twilio.twiml.VoiceResponse();
    const message = event.message || 'This is your appointment reminder. If you need to reschedule, please contact us.';
    twiml.say({voice: 'alice', language: 'en-US'}, message);
    twiml.pause({length: 2});
    twiml.say({voice: 'alice', language: 'en-US'}, 'Thank you, goodbye.');
    callback(null, twiml);
};
```

6. Click "Deploy"
7. Copy the URL (like: `https://xxx-xxxx.twilio.run/app`)
8. Tell me the URL

### 2️⃣ Ngrok (For Local Testing)

1. Download: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Terminal 1: `python src/twiml_server.py`
3. Terminal 2: `ngrok http 8000`
4. Copy URL: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`
5. Tell me the URL

### 3️⃣ Manual

Just tell me your TwiML endpoint URL and I'll update the app.

## What Happens After You Set It Up

Once you give me the URL, I'll update `src/caller.py` and then when you run:

```bash
python src/app.py data/ready_to_test.xlsx
```

You'll receive calls with your actual appointment message!

## Current Test File

Your test file has:
- 2 appointments
- Phone: 443-506-3813  
- Ready to call immediately

Once the TwiML is set up, you'll hear the actual appointment details!

**Ready?** Set up a Twilio Function (option 1) and give me the URL!
