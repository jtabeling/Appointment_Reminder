# Ready to Test! üéâ

## Current Status: 95% Complete

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- All code complete and tested
- Twilio credentials configured  
- Excel file updated with your phone: 443-506-3813
- 2 test appointments scheduled for future
- Application ready to run

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Last Step: TwiML Endpoint

**Without this, calls will fail!**

## Quick Setup (3 Options)

### Option 1: Ngrok (Easiest - 5 minutes)

1. **Download ngrok**: https://ngrok.com/download

2. **Install and run ngrok**:
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

3. **Start TwiML server** (in another terminal):
```bash
python src/twiml_server.py
```

4. **Run setup helper**:
```bash
python setup_twiml_ngrok.py
```
(Follow the prompts)

5. **Test the app**:
```bash
python src/app.py data/sample_appointments.xlsx
```

### Option 2: Twilio Functions (Best for Production)

1. Log into Twilio Console
2. Go to Functions & Assets
3. Create new function with this code:
```javascript
exports.handler = function(context, event, callback) {
    const twiml = new Twilio.twiml.VoiceResponse();
    const message = event.message || 'This is your appointment reminder.';
    twiml.say({voice: 'alice', language: 'en-US'}, message);
    twiml.pause({length: 2});
    twiml.say({voice: 'alice', language: 'en-US'}, 'Thank you, goodbye.');
    callback(null, twiml);
};
```
4. Deploy and copy the URL
5. Update `src/caller.py` line 222 with the function URL

### Option 3: Manual URL Update

If you have your own server running:
```bash
python setup_twiml_ngrok.py
# Just enter your server URL instead of ngrok
```

## Quick Test Without Calls

To verify everything works except actual calling:

```bash
python -c "
from src import config_loader, logger, data_processor, scheduler, caller
dp = data_processor.DataProcessor()
apps = dp.read_excel('data/sample_appointments.xlsx')
print(f'Loaded {len(apps)} appointments successfully')
for a in apps:
    print(f'  - {a.name}: {a.phone_number}')
"
```

Expected output:
```
Loaded 2 appointments successfully
  - Test User: 443-506-3813
  - Test User 2: 443-506.3813
```

## What Happens During Test

When you run `python src/app.py data/sample_appointments.xlsx`:

1. ‚úÖ Reads appointments from Excel
2. ‚úÖ Loads Twilio credentials
3. ‚úÖ Calculates reminder times (24h before appointments)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Schedules calls** (needs TwiML endpoint)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Places calls when due** (needs TwiML endpoint)

## Your Test Appointments

| Name | Phone | Appointment Time |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Test User | 443-506-3813 | Oct 31, 2025 11:52 AM |
| Test User 2 | 443-506.3813 | Nov 1, 2025 9:52 AM |

Reminder calls will be placed 24 hours before each appointment.

## Troubleshooting

**"Missing Twilio credentials"**
- Check `.env` file exists in project root
- Verify credentials are correct

**"Could not connect to TwiML endpoint"**
- Make sure ngrok is running
- Make sure twiml_server.py is running
- Check the URL in src/caller.py

**"Calls placed but you don't receive them"**
- Check your phone number format (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
- Verify Twilio account has credits
- Check Twilio logs in console

## Security Reminder

‚ö†Ô∏è **Change your Twilio Auth Token!**

It was shared in chat. To regenerate:
1. Twilio Console ‚Üí Account ‚Üí General
2. Auth Token section ‚Üí "Regenerate"
3. Update `.env` file

## Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
- ‚úÖ Application starts without errors
- ‚úÖ Logs show "Scheduled X reminder calls"
- ‚úÖ You receive phone calls at the scheduled times
- ‚úÖ Calls play the reminder message
